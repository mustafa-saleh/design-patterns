# Singleton Pattern

- Singleton is used when you only require one instance oF an objecct for example a logger class that needs to save all logs to certain storage
- Implementing Singleton with Singleton Class is more readable and self explanatory,
- you can also implement it by returning an instance from module
- Node automatically caches logger instance and return it whenever logger is called
