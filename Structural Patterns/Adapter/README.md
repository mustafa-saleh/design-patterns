# Adapter Pattern

- Adapter converts interface of a class into another that clients expects. Adapters lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.
- Adapter can be usefull to adapt an object to a different environment, for example "localStorage" is a browser API thats not available in node, we created LocalStorage adapter to bring browser API to node
