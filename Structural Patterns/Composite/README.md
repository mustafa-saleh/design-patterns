- Compose obejcts into trees to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of object uniformally.
- Composite is used when we want to execute an operation on an element and a group of elements.
- Composite workds with trees, an example of trees is a filesystem, folders are considered as branches and files as leafs, each beanch may contain branches and leafs. Composite allow to treate braches and leafs uniformally
